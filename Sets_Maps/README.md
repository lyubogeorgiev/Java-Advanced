Lab 01 - Parking Lot
-

Implementing a LinkedHashSet to simulate a parking lot. We enter cars to the parking lot by their license plate number 
and also removing them the same way. At the end we print all the cars which are in the parking lot in order of their 
appearance. If the parking lot is empty, then we print the message "Parking Lot is Empty" on the console.

Lab 01 - Book

The idea is that the constructor and setAuthor method can have a variable length of arguments - 0 or more.

Lab 02 - Library
-

Created a Library class which has an Array of type Book inside. Library class implements Iterable<> interface, and 
implements its method iterator() which is of type Iterator<>. There is an inside class of type Iterator<Book> which 
implements Iterator<> interface and its two methods hasNext() and next(). I the inside class there is also a counter 
to keep track on the position of the iterator.

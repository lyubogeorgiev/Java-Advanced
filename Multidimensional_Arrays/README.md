Lab 01 - Compare Matrices
-

Comparing two two dimensional int arrays by comparing their two dimension sizes first, and if they are equal then
comparing element by element for equality. 

Lab 02 - Position of
-

Iterating through a two-dimensional array to find all occurrences of a given number and print the indexes. If the number
doesn't exist in the array, then print "not found".

Lab 03 - Intersection of two matrices
- 

The problem of finding the intersection of two matrices was solved by creating 3rd matrix and comparing the elements of
first and the second matrices one by one and then if they are equal add the element to the third matrix at the same
position. If the elements are not the same then add * to the first matrix on that row and column position.

Lab 04 - Sum Matrix Elements
-

Read a matrix from the console, then iterate through each element and add to sum. At the end printing the dimensions of
the array - rows and columns, and the third row of output is the sum of elements. As there are a few way to solve this 
problem, oe of the ways is without creating an array - just straight forward read the numbers from the console and add 
them to the sum. Because the lesson is for two-dimensional arrays specifically, the problem is solved by using a
two-dimensional array - putting all elements and then loop through them to sum them.

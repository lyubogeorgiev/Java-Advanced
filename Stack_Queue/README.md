Lab 04 - Matching Brackets
-

The problem was solved by reading the input string character by character. When an open bracket character is read from the input string, its index in the string is pushed to a stack. When a closing bracket is read from the inout string, its index is taken as end index, and the topmost element in the stack is taken as a start index. Then a substring between start and end indexes is printed on the console. 

Lab 05 - Printer Queue
-

The solution of a printer queue was implemented by using a Queue data structure. The files to be printed could be canceled one by one, or if the printer queue is empty and the user tries to cancel a print job, it displays a message that "The printer is on Standby". Then all the files are printer in order of FIFO until the queue is empty.

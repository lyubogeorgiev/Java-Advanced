The problem was solved by reading the input string character by character. When an open bracket character is read from the input string, its index in the string is pushed to a stack. When a closing bracket is read from the inout string, its index is taken as end index, and the topmost element in the stack is taken as a start index. Then a substring between start and end indexes is printed on the console.
